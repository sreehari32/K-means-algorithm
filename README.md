# K-means-algorithm
This repository showcases an implementation of K-means clustering using both NumPy and scikit-learn libraries in Python. The K-means algorithm is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for clustering data into groups.

Features
Custom Implementation with NumPy: The repository provides a custom implementation of the K-means algorithm using NumPy, demonstrating the core concepts behind K-means clustering.

Scikit-learn Integration: It also utilizes the KMeans implementation from scikit-learn to perform K-means clustering. Scikit-learn is a powerful library for machine learning in Python, providing efficient implementations of various algorithms, including K-means.

Elbow Method for Determining Number of Clusters: The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset. This technique helps identify the point where the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) starts decreasing at a slower rate, indicating the optimal number of clusters.


Results
Consistency in Results: The repository demonstrates that the results obtained from the custom NumPy implementation and the scikit-learn KMeans implementation are consistent, ensuring the correctness of the algorithms.

Verification of Centroids: Both implementations are used to identify the centroids for the clusters. It is observed that the centroids obtained from both methods are the same, validating the accuracy of the scikit-learn implementation.
